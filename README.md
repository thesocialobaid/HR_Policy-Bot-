# HR Policy Chatbot

## Overview
The HR Policy Chatbot is an intelligent conversational application designed to provide quick and accurate responses to HR policy-related queries. Leveraging **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **FAISS** for efficient vector search, and **Streamlit** for an intuitive user interface, this chatbot retrieves relevant information from HR policy documents and generates natural, context-aware responses.

## Features
- **Natural Language Querying**: Users can ask HR policy questions in natural language and receive clear, concise answers.
- **Efficient Document Retrieval**: Utilizes FAISS for fast and accurate retrieval of relevant policy document sections.
- **RAG Pipeline**: Combines retrieval from a vectorized knowledge base with generative AI to produce contextually relevant responses.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with Streamlit, providing a user-friendly web interface for seamless interaction.
- **Scalable Knowledge Base**: Easily update or expand the HR policy document corpus to support new policies or organizations.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for the application.
- **FAISS**: For efficient similarity search and vector storage of policy documents.
- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive web-based user interface.
- **RAG Pipeline**: Combines document retrieval with a generative language model (e.g., Hugging Face transformers or similar).
- **Hugging Face Transformers** (optional, specify if used): For embeddings and response generation.
- **NumPy/Pandas**: For data preprocessing and handling.
- **LangChain** (optional, specify if used): For managing the RAG pipeline and document chunking.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hr-policy-chatbot.git
   cd hr-policy-chatbot
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Prepare the Knowledge Base**:
   - Place HR policy documents (PDFs, text files, etc.) in the `data/` directory.
   - Run the preprocessing script to generate embeddings:
     ```bash
     python preprocess.py
     ```

5. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   Access the chatbot at `http://localhost:8501` in your browser.

## Usage
1. **Launch the Chatbot**: Run `streamlit run app.py` to start the Streamlit app.
2. **Interact with the Chatbot**: Enter HR policy-related questions in the input box (e.g., "What is the leave policy?").
3. **View Results**: The chatbot retrieves relevant policy sections and generates a natural language response.
4. **Update Knowledge Base**: Add new documents to the `data/` folder and rerun `preprocess.py` to update the embeddings.

## Example Queries
- "What is the company's maternity leave policy?"
- "How many vacation days are employees entitled to?"
- "What are the remote work guidelines?"

## Future Improvements
- Add support for multilingual queries.
- Integrate with cloud-based storage for larger document corpora.
- Enhance response generation with fine-tuned LLMs for domain-specific accuracy.
- Implement user authentication for enterprise deployment.
